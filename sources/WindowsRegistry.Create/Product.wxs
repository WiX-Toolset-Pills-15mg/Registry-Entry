====================================================================================================
Start (Create): Overview
====================================================================================================

This project demonstrates how to add a value into the Windows Registry when the product is
installed.

Let's choose to add this pill's repository's url into the key in Windows Registry:
    - Key: HKLM\Software\Dust in the Wind\Windows Registry
    - Value: GitHub = https://github.com/WiX-Toolset-Pills-15mg/Windows-Registry
    
The only needed step is to add a new component for the registry value.
Let's start.
