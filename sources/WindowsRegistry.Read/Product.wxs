====================================================================================================
START (Read): Overview
====================================================================================================

This project demonstrates how to read a value from the Windows Registry when the product is
installed.

Let's read the Windows' version from the registry:
    - Key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
    - Value: ProductName

The only thing needed is to create a new property and initialize it with the value from the Windows
Registry.
