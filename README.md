## Windows Registry

Sometimes, when installing a product, the installer may need to read or write data from/to the Windows Registry. This can be done from C# using a custom action, but there is also a simpler way, directly from WiX Toolset.

## How to use

### a) Tutorial (article)

-  [doc/article/README.md](doc/article/README.md)

### b) Code example

- [sources](sources)
- I provided the complete Visual Studio solution that solves the described problem. Check it out whenever you fill the need to test it by yourself, in your environment or if you have further ideas that you want to verify.
